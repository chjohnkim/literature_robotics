# [A Robust Illumination-Invariant Camera System for Agricultural Applications]()

## Contribution
1. Present the design and validation of a high throughput rugged camera system that produces consistent quality images in varying light conditions.
    - Validation done by Structural Similiarty index and peak sigal-to-noise ratio
2. Quantitatively show that consistency in iamge quality elads to less data to train deep object detctor

## Method
- Custom built stereo camera with active lighting
- Dataset in apple orchard, with and without active lighting

## Result and Advantages 
- High quality of Neural Networks with less data
- Darkening of background
- No motion blur
- Color consistency
