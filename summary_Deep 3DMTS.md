# [Towards Active Robotic Vision in Agriculture: A Deep Learning Approach to Visual Servoing in Occluded and Unstructured Protected Cropping Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01885?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%253A+arxiv%252FQSXk+%2528ExcitingAds%2521+cs+updates+on+arXiv.org%2529)

- Robotic harvesting platform "Harvey" for harvesting sweet peppers

- 3DMTS: 3D Move to See - 3D array of 9 cameras, used to check gradient of occluded fruit to visual servo manipulator

## Contribution
Deep learning approach for single camera 3DMTS; improve practicality of original 3DMTS

## Lit Review
- Morrision, D. Corke, P. and Leitner, J. (2018). Multiview picking: next-best-view reaching for improved grasping in clutter. In, 2019 IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robotics and Systems (IROS), (In Press). IEEE, Macau, China.

## Method
Used data (center image and output gradient) from original 3DMTS to train Deep-3DMTS

## Experiment
- Only in simulation
- Performs similar to baseline, but doesn't demosntrate on real robot. No improvement in cylce time reported.
